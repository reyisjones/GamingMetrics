{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Game",
  "newMetric": 42
}
```

2. Update `GameCard.jsx` to display it:
```jsx
<Box sx={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <Typography>New Metric</Typography>
  <Typography>{game.newMetric}</Typography>
</Box>
```

3. Add a chart in `Dashboard.jsx`:
```jsx
<MetricsChart title="New Metric" dataKey="newMetric" games={games} />
```

4. Write tests in `src/test/`:
```jsx
it('displays new metric', () => {
  renderWithTheme(<GameCard game={mockGame} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('New Metric')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
